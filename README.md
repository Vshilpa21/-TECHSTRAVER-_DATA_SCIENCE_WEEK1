PROJECT 1: PASSWORD GENERATOR

A password is a combination of lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and 
digits. An ideal or a strong password contains a combination of these 
four.

1)Import random: To randomly generate a password we use this module. 
Random is a built-in module used to generate a random subset or a 
substring of a list, array or string. In our case, it will generate a random 
string containing characters from the original string. 

Get User Input 
o Ask the user for the desired length of the password. 
o Optionally, ask the user for specific requirements (e.g., include/exclude 
special characters, minimum number of digits, etc.).  
o Ensure the user inputs a valid number for the password length. 
o Allow users to specify minimum counts for each character type (e.g., at least 2 
digits).

2)Using gui (OPTIONAL) 
Create a simple GUI using libraries like tkinter for a more user-friendly 
experience.

Project 2 : QR Code Generator

QR Code Generator is an applica on that takes in a url or a string 
and creates a qr code for it. Here we can save the generated QR 
code as an image with the .png extension. 

1) Required Libraries and Modules: 
 Tkinter Module – Tkinter Module helps to create the GUI 
window for our project. 
 Png Module – This helps to save an image in the png 
extension. 
 Pyqrcode Module – This Module helps to generate a QR 
Code.
